## Description of Project
This project provides a method for LLMs to detect the political bias of the Western media especially the BBC and the Guardian. Three methods are used that BERT, ChatGPT and Deepseek. We make a comparison among these three models outcomes and also analyse the shifts of the politcal bias before and during some gobal events like the Russia-Ukraine War.

## Description of Dataset
Guardian data: the article news from the Guardian between 2017 to 2022
BBC data: the article news from the BBC between 2018 to 2024

## Models
**BERT-based model**: The BERT model is a pre-trained large language model that can detect the political bias.
**ChatGPT model**: Apply the api from ChatGPT and detect the political bias.
**Deepseek model**: Apply the api from Deepseek and detect the political bias.

## Framework
Get the outcomes of each model and make a longtitudal analysis to find the change of political leanings also the comparison among models.
